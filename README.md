## List of Classes 

### Class StringProcessor
StringProcessor implements several methods to deal with problems of string process.

#### Methods:
* `uniqueString` – remove all duplicate characters in an input string.
  * ex: an input like `ppto` will output `pto`

* `isAnagrams` – take two input strings to test if they are anagrams to each other.
  * ex: string inputs `j opj` and `jpo j` will output `true`, which means they are anagrams. Otherwise, it is `false`.

* `isRotation` – check if an input string is a rotation of another.
  * ex: string inputs `erbottlewat` and `waterbottle` will output `true`. Otherwise, `false`.
